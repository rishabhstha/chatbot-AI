238,https://cs.olemiss.edu/faq/,"Our BSCS and BA, can be described as flexible, generalist degrees in computer science. The focus of these degrees tends to be on software development and systems-level issues. There is a strong foundation consisting of the fundamental theories, technologies, and skills of computing. On this foundation, the students can select electives in computer science and other areas to specialize their programs to specific application areas or to continue to explore foundational issues. Some students have used the flexibility of the BSCS as a springboard for further professioal study in law, business, or medicine."
239,https://cs.olemiss.edu/faq/,"Those more interested in the deeper issues of computer hardware design may want to consider the computer engineering emphasis on the BSEE degree offered by the Department of Electrical Engineering. The degree program combines a rigorous ABET/EAC-accredited degree program in electrical engineering with what is essentially a minor in computer science. Of course, BSCS students interested in hardware issues can also choose electrical engineering courses for their electives, perhaps completing a formal minor in engineering."
240,https://cs.olemiss.edu/faq/,"The Management Informantion Systems (MIS) program in the School of Business Administration may be a better fit for some students. This is essentially a general business degree with emphasis on the application of information technologies and information systems principles to business problems. The MIS program tends to focus more on the behavioral aspects of computing than the technical aspects. Of course, BSCS students can also take business courses for some of their technical electives and/or prepare to study for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree upon completion of the BSCS."
241,https://cs.olemiss.edu/faq/,"Students interested in the visual, artistic aspects of Web design may want to consider the offerings of the Department of Art in the College of Liberal Arts. For example, the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree offers a concentration in graphic/Web design. Students in this program learn about the artistic techniques of graphic design, including how to apply those principles in the design of Web sites. Students in this field use graphics application software to create the images that appear as part of Web applications. In general, these students do not get involved with technical, programming aspects of Web design. On the other hand, computer science graduates should be well equipped for the Web programming and even the development of the graphic applications that graphic designers use in their work. Of course, BSCS students with interests in both the technical and visual aspects of Web design can use their electives to take art courses."
242,https://cs.olemiss.edu/faq/,"The University of Mississippi readily accepts the transfer of college-level, academic course credit from other regionally accredited institutions in the USA.

243,https://cs.olemiss.edu/faq/,"Junior and community college students planning to continue their studies at a four-year institution such as Ole Miss should be mindful of the limitations of the technical or technology courses and programs offered at those institutions. Those may be quite good programs, but they are vocationally oriented programs designed for students who plan to study for two years and then directly enter the workforce with specific skills. Often the technical courses will not transfer to four-year institutions such as Ole Miss. Of course, the regular, academic programs and courses offered by community colleges may be quite good options for many students to take. However, prospective transfer students should be careful to coordinate their community college studies with the expectations of the senior college to which they expect to transfer. Prospective transfer students should also note that no more than one-half of the credit required for an Ole Miss degree program may be transferred from a junior or community college."
